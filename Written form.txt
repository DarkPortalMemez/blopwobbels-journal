Day 18476;
Wilbur came to visit me.
He gave me this journal to write in.
I shall do my best.
Day 18477;
No sign of anyone today, just plain loneliness.
Day 18478;
I cried today.
Day 18479;
I can't even feel my legs, are they still there?
I am scared, pissed off and lonely.
Day 18480;
Help.
Day 18481;
Am i going insane? I probably am going insane.
Other wise i wouldn't be here would I?
What am i saying?
Day 18482;
Cried today.
Day 18483;
Thinking about writing a communist manifesto.
Day 18484;
How long has it been?
I've not been able to feel my legs for days now.
I don't know if it will ever come back.
Day 18485;
Why are we still here?
Just to suffer?
Every night, I can't feel my leg cause i lost feeling in my leg days ago.
Day 18486;
Cried today.
Day 18487;
To be or not to be, that's not the question.
The question is ....
I don't know dude.
I can't feel my leg, i Just don't know.
Help.
Day 18488;
Didn't cry today.
Day 18489;
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHG
Day 18490;
I thought i was able to feel my leg today, but I think it was just a dream.
Every dream now takes place in this hole. Also I didn't cry today.
That's a lie i did cry.
Day 18491;
For real didn't cry today
Day 18492;
I don't know why i said that yesterday cause i really did cry.
Day 18493;
What is the definiton of bedrock? Is it to suffer? It feels course, rough, irritating, and it gets everywhere.
However i now see the bedrock as my friend.
It makes me feel less lonely although it's not by much.
You see, this bedrock has a personality.
It's more than just stone. He looks over my shoulder while I'm writing this.
I haven't talked to him yet, i'm too shy for that.
Probably going to do that in a few days, if I'm still alive by then.
I can only hope.
That's all i have, isn't it? Hope. And bedrock of course. Two things.
Bedrock and hope. Might be the title of my autobiography once i get out.
If I get out.
Sorry for the long post, TLDR: Cried today.
Day 18494; should i start writing my biography, just in case? Or could this journal be my biography.
By the way, I can't feel my leg.
Not sure if I wrote that already.
A few days ago I thought it was back, but it was just a dream, alas.
Day 18495;
Pain.
Day 18496;
No pain today, did cry though.
Day 18497;
Had pain and cried today. Shit.
Day 18498;
I heared a loud scream in the distance, as if a wilbur soot got jumpscared.
It was weird but it did make me realise that there is still life outside of this box.
It gives me hope.
Hope and bedrock.
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
Day 18499;
Heard someone scream: 'EVERYONE TO THE SURFACE'
It hurts.
Day 18500;
Whoo, a milestone!
18500 days!
Still can't feel my leg though
Day 18501;
Gotta say, 18501 is less fun than 18502. How do i even know when it is day?
Maybe I've been here for much longer than that. Maybe i've only vbeen here for just an hour. I just don't know dude. I just don't know.
Help me.
